    <!-- Overview -->
    <section class="section">
        <p>
            My current research lies at the interface of <strong>quantum dynamics</strong>,
            <strong>cavity quantum electrodynamics</strong>, and
            <strong>condensed-phase chemical physics</strong>.
            I am broadly interested in how quantum coherence, dissipation, and
            strong light-matter coupling work together to determine
            chemical reactivity, photophysics, and transport in complex environments, 
            which are often in close contact with ongoing experiments.
        </p>
        <p>
            Methodologically, I work on rigorous and approximate
            <strong>open quantum system approaches</strong>, including
            hierarchical equations of motion, quantum master equations,
            mixed quantum-classical dynamics, and path-integral inspired methods.
            I also employ finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations 
            to study electromagnetic field
            interacting with (chiral) molecular systems in nanophotonic environments.

        <h2>Quantum Dynamics Methods</h2>
        <p>
            A central theme of my work is the development and application of
            quantum dynamics methods for open systems in condensed phases.
            These methods aim to capture non-Markovian environmental effects,
            quantum coherence, dephasing and decoherence, on equal footing.

        <h2>Cavity QED and Polaritonic Chemistry</h2>
        <p>
            A major focus of my doctoral and postdoctoral research is
            <strong>collective strong light-matter coupling</strong> and
            its impact on chemical dynamics.
            By embedding molecules or materials inside optical cavities or
            nanophotonic structures (that constructed with specific experimental
            platforms, including Fabry-Pérot microcavities, plasmonic structures, 
            organic materials, 2D materials, and so on), one can form hybrid 
            light-matter states (polaritons) that modify reaction pathways and 
            energy-transport channels.

                <strong>Vibrational Polariton Chemistry.</strong>
                Recent experiments have demonstrated that chemical kinetics 
                can be enhanced or suppressed by coupling molecular vibrations 
                to quantized radiation modes inside an optical microcavity.
                This phenomenon is referred to as the vibrational strong coupling 
                (VSC) enabled change of reactivities. This new strategy of VSC, if feasible, 
                will allow one to bypass some intrinsic difficulties 
                (such as intramolecular vibrational energy transfer) 
                encountered in mode-selective chemistry that uses infrared (IR) excitation 
                to tune chemical reactivities, offering a paradigm shift of synthetic chemistry 
                through cavity-enabled bond-selective chemical transformations. 
                I have been performing quantum-dynamical studies of how coupling molecular vibrations
                to cavity modes can enhance, suppress, or reshape reaction rates,
                including the identification of “resonant suppression” conditions
                and the role of dark-state manifolds.

                <strong>Exciton-Polariton Photophysics and Transport.</strong>
                Microscopic modelling of exciton-photon hybridization in
                inorganic and organic (molecular) systems. 
                Analysis of how disorder, vibronic coupling, and cavity
                loss affect exciton and polariton relaxation, decoherence, 
                and propagation. For polariton transport, my research includes
                the emergence of ballistic vs diffusive regimes and the
                possibility of long-range transport under strong coupling,
                with particular interest in group-velocity renormalization, 
                dispersion engineering, and the role of quantum coherence.

                Marcus-Jortner-type descriptions with microscopic cavity QED
                and to clarify under what conditions cavity modes can
                substantially alter charge-transfer kinetics.

                (such as the FDTD approach)
                to bridge between microscopic quantum-dynamics descriptions
                and realistic field profiles in cavities, plasmonic resonators,
                and metasurfaces, with particular interest in chirality.
