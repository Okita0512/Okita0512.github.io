        <h2>Research Overview</h2>
        <p>
            My research lies at the interface of <strong>quantum dynamics</strong>,
            <strong>cavity quantum electrodynamics</strong>, and
            <strong>condensed-phase chemical physics</strong>.
            I am broadly interested in how quantum coherence, dissipation, and
            strong light–matter coupling work together to determine
            chemical reactivity, photophysics, and transport in complex environments.
        </p>
        <p>
            Methodologically, I work on rigorous and approximate
            <strong>open quantum system approaches</strong>, including
            hierarchical equations of motion, quantum master equations,
            mixed quantum–classical dynamics, and path-integral inspired methods.
            On the application side, I study
            <strong>polaritonic chemistry</strong>,
            <strong>exciton-polariton photophysics and transport</strong>,
            and <strong>electron transfer in confined electromagnetic fields</strong>,
            often in close contact with ongoing experiments.

        <h2>Quantum Dynamics Methods</h2>
        <p>
            A central theme of my work is the development and application of
            <strong>quantum dynamics methods</strong> for open systems in condensed phases.
            These methods aim to capture non-Markovian environmental effects,
            quantum coherence, and strong system–bath coupling on equal footing.

        <h2>Cavity QED and Polaritonic Chemistry</h2>
        <p>
            A major focus of my doctoral and postdoctoral research is
            <strong>collective strong light–matter coupling</strong> and
            its impact on chemical dynamics.
            By embedding molecules or materials inside optical cavities or
            nanophotonic structures, one can form hybrid light–matter states
            (polaritons) that modify reaction pathways and energy-transport channels.

                and to clarify under what conditions cavity modes can
                substantially alter charge-transfer kinetics.
